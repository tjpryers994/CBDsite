# CBD OIL DROP SERVICE

In this project I will build a website that advertises a CBD oil subscription service.
There will be 3 pages a Landing page that shows the product and advertises there will be a page that describes what cbd is.

The second page will be a page telling people what CBD is what benefits it has and a bit of history which I have researched a little bit on.

## UX Process:

What I had in mind when I thought of this was to make a mobile first website using bootstrap.

I will be targeting people that vape and want a cbd oil vape liquid. Will be a easy to navigate mimimalist design for users making sure it is easy to navigate as possible.

## Features:

The features I will include are a landing page which will be the main advert and a link/button to lead to a sign up page to sign up for the service.
There will also be a page that includes 4 card explaining what CBD is, its benefits, a brief history and quotes from users already getting the service.


There will be a nav bar that is easy to find at top of the page to easily navigate the page.
At the bottom will be a footer with social links linking to pages

### What I might add:
I might add a link linking to the pages I looked into to research into CBD for users to follow and learn more about it themselves

## Technologies used:
The technologies I have use are HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.
Bootstrap is used a lot in this project.
